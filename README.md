## 📖 Overview

This is home to my personal Kubernetes lab cluster. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my cluster based on the manifests in the [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) directory. [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository and creates pull requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts, and other dependencies.

## ⛵ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [talos](https://talos.dev/) running on proxmox VMs. This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for data storage.

🔸 _[Click here](./ansible/) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components

- [cilium](https://cilium.io): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect)
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which are commited to Git
- [Democratic CSI](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi): Provides block and NFS storage provisioning
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
├── 📁 talos           # main cluster
│   ├─📁 apps          # applications

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in and only saves me roughly $18/month.

## 🌐 DNS

### Home DNS

On my Vyos router I have [Bind9](https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9) and [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/) deployed as containers. In my cluster `external-dns` is deployed with the `RFC2136` provider which syncs DNS records to `bind9`.

Downstream DNS servers configured in `dnsdist` such as `bind9` (above) and [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html). All my clients use `dnsdist` as the upstream DNS server, this allows for more granularity with configuring DNS across my networks. These could be things like giving each of my VLANs a specific `adguard` profile, or having all requests for my domain forward to `bind9` on certain networks, or only using `1.1.1.1` instead of `adguard` on certain networks where adblocking isn't required.

### Public DNS

Outside the `external-dns` instance mentioned above another instance is deployed in my cluster and configured to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingress this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an ingress class name of `external` and contain an ingress annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.

## 🤝 Gratitude and Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [kubesearch.dev](kubesearch.dev) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
